             <h1>What is an Organic Farming?</h1>
             <p>Organic farming is an agricultural system that uses fertilizers of <br>organic origin such as compost manure, green manure, and bone <br>meal and places emphasis on techniques such as crop rotation and <br>companion planting. It originated early in the 20th century in reaction <br>to rapidly changing farming practices. Certified organic agriculture <br>accounts for 70 million hectares globally, with over half of that total <br>in Australia. Organic farming continues to be developed by various <br>organizations today. Biological pest control, mixed cropping and <br>the fostering of insect predators are encouraged. Organic standards are <br>designed to allow the use of naturally-occurring substances <br>while prohibiting or strictly limiting synthetic substances. For<br>instance, naturally-occurring pesticides such as pyrethrin and <br>rotenone are permitted, while synthetic fertilizers<br>and pesticides are generally prohibited. Synthetic substances that<br>are allowed include, for example, copper sulfate, elemental <br>sulfur and Ivermectin. Genetically modified organisms, <br>nanomaterials, human sewage sludge, plant growth regulators, <br>hormones, and antibiotic use in livestock husbandry are <br>prohibited.Organic farming advocates claim advantages <br>in sustainability, openness, self-sufficiency, autonomy <br>and independence,[6] health, food security, and food safety. </p>
